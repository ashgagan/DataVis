            Welcome to our Data Visualization Assignment for COS30045! This project, crafted by Henry Sutton and Gagandeep Singh, showcases the power of data visualization in understanding complex datasets. We have developed two interactive visualizations to explore and analyze various health-related data. These visualizations aim to provide insights into how different factors, such as sugar supply, tobacco consumption, and fat supply, correlate with life expectancy across different countries and years. Use the navigation menu above to explore each visualization, and immerse yourself in the data-driven stories they unveil.</p>

                Our first data visualization presents a comprehensive overview of global life expectancy trends over the years. Using an intuitive interface, you can select different countries and years to examine the life expectancy variations. The visualization employs dynamic charts and maps to highlight patterns and anomalies in the data. This allows you to explore how life expectancy has evolved across different regions and what factors might be influencing these changes. Dive into this visualization to uncover the hidden stories within the life expectancy data, and gain a deeper understanding of global health trends.

            <p>Introduction to Visualization 2</br>
                Our second data visualization delves into the intricate relationships between various health factors and life expectancy. This interactive radar chart allows you to select a country and year to examine the sugar supply, tobacco consumption, and total fat supply for that specific context. By visualizing these factors simultaneously, you can easily compare their relative values and understand how they might influence life expectancy. Hover over the chart to reveal detailed data points and insights. This visualization offers a unique perspective on how different dietary and lifestyle choices can impact health outcomes, providing valuable context for public health discussions. Explore the data to discover patterns and draw your own conclusions about the interplay between these crucial health metrics and life expectancy.
